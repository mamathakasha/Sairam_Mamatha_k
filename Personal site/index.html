	<h3>
		<b>Samadhi Mandir</b>
	</h3>
	<p>Samādhi or samadhi mandir is the Hindi name for a temple, shrine
		or memorial commemorating the dead (similar to a tomb or mausoleum),
		which may or may not contain the body of the deceased. Samadhi sites
		are often built in this way to honor people regarded as saints or
		gurus in Hindu religious traditions, wherein such souls are said to
		have passed into mahāsamādhi, or were already in samādhi
		(non-dualistic state of consciousness) at the time of death.</p>
